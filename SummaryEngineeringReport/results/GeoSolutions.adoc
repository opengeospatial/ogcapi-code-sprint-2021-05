==== GeoSolutions

GeoSolutions deployed an instance of the GeoServer product. GeoServer is a Java-based software server that allows users to view and edit geospatial data. Using open standards by the OGC, GeoServer allows for great flexibility in map creation and data sharing. For this code sprint, the server was configured to offer an endpoint supporting:

* Multiple conformance classes and recommendations of the draft OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core specification.
* Multiple conformance classes and recommendations of the draft OGC API - Tiles - Part 1: Core specification.
* Multiple conformance classes and recommendations of the draft OGC API - Styles - Part 1: Core specification.
* Multiple conformance classes and recommendations of the OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core Standard.

The development focused on updating the OGC API - Tiles implementation to the latest evolution of the spec, as well as setting up a permanent demonstration server for OGC API implementations

===== The demo server

The https://gs-main.geosolutionsgroup.com/geoserver[gs-main demo server] tracks the development branch of GeoServer. With three deployments a day it closely tracks the latest evolutions of the software. On the flip side, because of this, the server can be at times unstable.


In particular, the server offers:

* The classic GeoServer demo datasets, such as Manhattan roads, Spearfish, Tasmania and the demographic "states" layers,
* The full https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-zoomstack[ZoomStack dataset] from Ordnance Survey, with full set of https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Open-Zoomstack-Stylesheets/tree/master/GeoPackage/Styled%20Layer%20Descriptors%20(SLD)[SLD styles alternatives] exposed by the Styles API.
* The Reseaux River basin digital elevation model from Natural Resources Canada

The server offers the following OGC APIs:

- Features
- Maps
- Styles
- Tiles
- DGGS (though currently there are no DGGS enabled datasets in it)

===== Updating OGC API Tiles

The GeoServer implementation of OGC API Tiles dated back to the Vector Tiles Pilot 2, the API got significantly updated in the meantime.

In particular, before the update a single templated URL was offered to the clients, that was parameterized on a number of elements, e.g.:

``../ogc/tiles/collections/testCollection/map/{styleId}/tiles/{tileMatrixSetId}/{tileMatrix}/{tileRow}/{tileCol}?f=image%2Fpng``

In order to fill the template, the client would pick the styles from the collection style list, and the tile matrix set from the dedicated resource.
However, in the current incarnation, new intermediate resources have been added that progressively reveal the components of the path:

- A "styles" resource containing links to the available styles
- A "map" resource for each collection and style, providing a link to the available tilesets
- A "tileset" resource finally providing a templated link with the familiar "z/y/x" template variables, e.g.:

`` http://gs-main.geosolutionsgroup.com/geoserver/ogc/tiles/collections/oszoom%3Aroads_regional/styles/oszoom:roads_regional-road/map/tiles/WebMercatorQuad/{tileMatrix}/{tileRow}/{tileCol}?f=image%2Fpng8``

This eases usage for clients that happen to support generic ``xyz`` tilesets, at least as long as the ``WebMercatorQuad`` tile matrix set is used.
