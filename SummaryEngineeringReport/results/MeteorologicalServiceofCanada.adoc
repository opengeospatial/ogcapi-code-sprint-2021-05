==== Meteorological Service of Canada

The Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) is a federal department of the
Government of Canada.  MSC works in close collaboration with NRCan to align
national spatial data infrastructure activities in support of providing
data to Canadians, as well as in meeting Canada's international commitments
with the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

MSC provides weather, climate, and water data via its https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weather-general-tools-resources/weather-tools-specialized-data/msc-geomet-api-geospatial-web-services.html[MSC GeoMet API platform],
which offers both first generation OGC Web Services (WMS, WCS) as well as
OGC API standards (OGC API - Features, OGC API - Processes).

MSC's participation in the sprint is driven by the need for lowering the
barrier to entry to weather/climate/water data for both existing and new
information communities as well as the mass market.  The OGC API efforts
are well positioned to extend the reach of MSC data, and the availability
of implementations further helps with this goal.

MSC's evolving OGC API offerings are provided using the https://pygeoapi.io[pygeoapi]
product.  pygeoapi is an open source Python server implementation of the OGC
API suite of standards.  The product supports the microservices approach and
allows for scalability and cloud friendly deployment. At the time of publishing
this engineering report, the pygeoapi 0.9.0 product is https://www.ogc.org/resource/products/details/?pid=1663[certified OGC compliant]
to the OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core standard, and additionally implements
the following standards:

- The draft OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core specification
- The draft OGC API - Tiles - Part 1: Core specification
- The draft OGC API - Coverages - Part 1: Core specification
- The draft OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core specification
- The OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval Standard
- The OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core Standard
- SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog

During the sprint, MSC deployed an instance of pygeoapi and worked with
OSGeo colleagues from GeoCat BV and Geobeyond Srl to implement an endpoint
supporting the abovementioned standards, as well as the following feature
enhancements developed during the sprint:

- The draft OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core specification
- The draft OGC API - Styles - Part 1: Core specification

MSC also collaborated with Ecere in testing and https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/issues/699[updating OGC API - Tiles
support in pygeoapi] to align with recent iterations of the specification.

A screenshot from a demonstration a pygeoapi instance during the code sprint
is shown in <<img_pygeoapi>>.

The resulting work can be found in a pygeoapi https://github.com/tomkralidis/pygeoapi/tree/oamaps[feature branch].
The work will continue to evolve as the OGC API - Maps and OGC API - Styles
specifications evolve.

During the code sprint, MSC also extended the Python https://geopython.github.io/OWSLib[OWSLib]
client library to support OGC API - Maps and OGC API - Styles.  The https://github.com/tomkralidis/OWSLib/tree/oamaps[resulting work]
will continue to evolve with specification development.

Finally, MSC raised support of dimensions in OGC API - Maps as a
https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-code-sprint-2021-05/issues/27[discussion]
in the context of MetOcean requirements.
