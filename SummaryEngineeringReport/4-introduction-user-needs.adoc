To help the sprint participants prioritize their efforts, the sprint organizers invited Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) to outline User Needs from NRCan's perspective as a National Mapping Agency (NMA). This section summarizes the user needs.

==== Introduction to Natural Resources Canada

Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) is a part of the Federal Government of Canada. NRCan is mandated to ensure the sustainable development of Canada's natural resources, allowing the department's work to explore energy, minerals and metals, forests, earth sciences, mapping, and remote sensing. Geospatial data plays a key role in all of the aforementioned areas, hence NRCan's interest in the development of OGC APIs. As the NMA of Canada, NRCan plays a critical nation-wide role in the distribution of authoritative geospatial data products, including cartographic products such as maps.

==== The Priorities that drive the Need for APIs

There are specific priorities that drive what NRCan would like to see from OGC APIs. These include for example: climate change, response to disasters/extreme events, the Arctic, trade, sovereignty, and Indigenous reconciliation. The government has a strong desire to have collaboration and innovation within government processes in order to benefit Canadian society broadly. Innovation provides a bridge between the government's internal focus areas and how these will apply within Canada and its position in the world. So, indeed, all the OGC APIs that are being developed through this sprint will, in the future, help to benefit society.


==== Specific Needs

OGC APIs have a substantial role to play in the future of NMAs. At NRCan, this role is likely to involve the development and provision of microservices in order to support the delivery of geospatial data, maps and analytics. This role can be described in terms of the following needs:

* *Providing the public with access to geospatial data and maps*: This is a key function of an NMA. OGC APIs have the potential to help NMAs to provide open data in a way that conforms to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). This enables the members of the public to make use of the geospatial data and maps as they see fit (e.g. in support of other parts of the community or economy).

* *Facilitating analytics*: Making geospatial a fundamental part of national decision making requires consideration of how to optimize the use of location information. By focusing firstly on analytics, geospatial experts can be enabled to help others, then those experts can make better decisions through geospatial information analytics.

* *Reducing barriers to accessing geospatial data*: Geospatial data has become more accessible over the past decade. However, there has also been a significant increase in the demand for knowledge and expertise in all sorts of development to use geospatial information. Significant need also exists to extend geospatial information accessibility to individuals with disabilities to ensure everyone can benefit from geospatial data.

==== Sprint Areas of Interest

For demonstration purposes, Sprint participants were encouraged to publish specific data and maps through OGC APIs for the following Areas of Interest (AOI):
